Training-Free Automated Progressive Red Teaming (TF-APRT)

This module implements a training/fine-tuning-free approach to automated progressive 
red teaming that can work with any language model through strategic prompt engineering
and in-context learning.

Key Features:
- Zero-shot intention expanding through carefully crafted prompts
- Zero-shot intention hiding through adversarial prompt generation
- Dynamic prompt adaptation based on success/failure patterns
- Model-agnostic design compatible with any LLM API or local model
- Progressive difficulty scaling based on target model responses
